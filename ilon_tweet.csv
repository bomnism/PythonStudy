There is the internal goal if things go right, which needs to be aggressive. Obviously, some things will not go right internally & there will be external issues too. 

That said, I think we can stack an orbital ship on an orbital booster in July.

Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the “keep out zone”, which is unreasonably gigantic. 

There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken.

Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS! That’s the highest overall rating, but we think we can get max score for all subcategories/individual tests too. 

Retesting in a month or so with improved software. The improved software will then be uploaded to all cars with FSD computers.

Good chart. This is a major reason why we moved Starlink from ~1100km orbit to ~550km. Atmosphere automatically clears the lower altitude within a few years, so space junk cannot accumulate.

This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.

When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions.

That’s where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range).

Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs & mid range cars.

Becoming multiplanetary is one of the greatest filters. Only now, 4.5 billion years after Earth formed, is it possible. 

How long this window to reach Mars remains open is uncertain. Perhaps a long time, perhaps not. 

In case it is the latter, we should act now.

Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.

Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full & can stabilize grid.

Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.

While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI. That is what Tesla is doing, both in hardware & software.

Unless a company is good at AI with tight compute, it’s hopeless. This is insanely hard.

Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). 

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. 

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.

Ascent phase, transition to horizontal & control during free fall were good. 

A (relatively) small CH4 leak led to fire on engine 2 & fried part of avionics, causing hard start attempting landing burn in CH4 turbopump. 

This is getting fixed 6 ways to Sunday.

Agreed! We’re not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We’re also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power.

Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield & stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.

However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating & land intact.

Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent & didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed. 

Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.

If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.

A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. 

Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.

Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has “spare” performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.

Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.

There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. 

Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.

Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. 

Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.

Prices in the US (of all goods) don’t include VAT, but it’s usually included in other countries. 

Then there’s import duty & transport costs.

The intent is that revenue to Tesla is roughly similar in all countries, so taxes, tariffs & transport make up the difference.

Most people have no idea, even though there are so many FSD progress videos posted. Munro understood right away. 

There will be a gap before the next release, but then it will be a step change better.

An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto.

Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.

That data, like all data, is subject to latency & error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both.

Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky

He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.

Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.

Strange, if true. 

- Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.

- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?

Perhaps slightly more confident, but it’s essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.

The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you’re probably not infectious above 30 & you probably are below 25. Sound about right?

Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles & 40 cycles is their max.

Possible explanation for the dramatic decline in cold & flu prevalence vs prior years. If someone comes in with cold/flu symptoms & falsely tests positive for cov2, they will assume they have it, when in fact they simply have some other form of seasonal cold/flu.

Moreover, lower the true prevalence, the higher the false positive number will be. This sounds obvious, but it could mean a very high false positive percentage if true prevalence is low.

We measure this primarily in intervention probability. This update addressed several issues, resulting in perhaps ~1/3 fewer interventions. Many of the improvements consist of fixing silly bugs vs grand eureka moments. True for most beta releases in my experience.

To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades. 

Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.

GM & Toyota took everything that worked & moved it to their other factories.

Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes.

Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.

For Dojo, we’re betting on FP16 with floating floating point (essentially, truncating mostly zeroes), so it feels like FP32 & existing software just works. We considered FP8 for a while, but everyone hated it. I even asked Twitter! For inference, int8 works great.

The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC & differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.

Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.

I don’t want be cavalier, but there isn’t an obvious limit. 100+ flights are possible. Some parts will need to be replaced or upgraded. Cleaning all 9 Merlin turbines is difficult. Raptor is way easier in this regard, despite being a far more complex engine.

It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant & pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers & stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!

Max demonstrated Raptor thrust is ~225 tons & min is ~90 tons, so they’re actually quite similar. Both Merlin & Raptor could throttle way lower with added design complexity. Raptor preburner & Merlin gas generator flameout are what limit lower bound.

The FSD improvement will come as a quantum leap, because it’s a fundamental architectural rewrite, not an incremental tweak. I drive the bleeding edge alpha build in my car personally. Almost at zero interventions between home & work. Limited public release in 6 to 10 weeks.

The rate of improvement from original GPT to GPT-3 is impressive. If this rate of improvement continues, GPT-5 or 6 could be indistinguishable from the smartest humans. Just my opinion, not an endorsement. I left OpenAI 2 to 3 years ago. Am a neutral outsider at this point.

Starlink terminal has motors to self-orient for optimal view angle. No expert installer required. Just plug in & give it a clear view of the sky. Can be in garden, on roof, table, pretty much anywhere, so long as it has a wide view of the sky.

To revolutionize space, the right metric is mass to orbit or you could translate that to # of useful satellites brought to orbit. No substitute for mass though. Scale don’t lie.

Mass to orbit is a more accurate metric than # of launches, although should be orbit-adjusted (eg GTO>LEO), which would increase competitor mass numbers

We’re seeing field false positives much higher than lab false positives, in range of 5% to 10%. Article says testing went from 100k to 600k, which means a 6-fold increase in false positives. My guess is most cases, especially “no symptoms”, are false positives.

The news is sometimes created, but always curated. The latter is most pernicious. On any given day, there are thousands of potential stories. By picking which stories are written about & how prominently they’re placed, a handful of publishers control much of the public narrative.

Something’s messed up about medicine that’s anti-science. In science, you question everyone, no matter who they are. Facts & reasoning are everything, but in medicine too much emphasis is on credentials, often by people who’ve accomplished nothing but a PhD thesis used by no one.

Extremely big difference between died because of or died with. Also, did the person actually have C19 or did they just have C19 symptoms? It’s almost impossible to die without feeling weakness, shortness of breath or other C19 symptoms, unless you were crushed by a falling piano.

There are a lot of C19 false positives messing up the numbers. Even tests with 5% false positive rate (in *field*, not lab) would show up as ~17 million  fake C19 cases even if there were actually none.

There are a ridiculous number of false positive C19 tests, in some cases ~50%. False positives scale linearly with # of tests. This is a big part of why C19 positive tests are going up while hospitalizations & mortality are declining. Anyone who tests positive should retest.

Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out.

Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed.

Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.

We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights.

Forward thrusters are to stabilize ship when landing in high winds. If goal is max payload to moon per ship, no heatshield or flaps or big gas thruster packs are needed. No need to bring early ships back. They can serve as part of moon base alpha.

Outcome-based contracting with multiple competitors is vastly better than cost-plus (especially if sole-sourced), as the former rewards results & latter rewards waste. Outcome contracting should be applied broadly within government. The difference in results will be incredible.

Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something! This article incorrectly conflates invasive as “ventilator”, but makes many good points
Is this proof 'live-saving' ventilators are actually deathtraps?
New York casualty doctor Cameron Kyle-Sidell has broken ranks with the medical establishment and warns it is wrong to use ventilators in the same way as pneumonia.

You’d think they’d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive & non-invasive. It’s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are “real ventilators”.

2012: Dragon docks with ISS
2015: Booster land landing
2016: Sea landing
2017: Booster reuse
2018: Falcon Heavy debut

Pretty much, although we also sent some Medtronic units, which are meant for extreme situations. Those require a lot of work to set up & operate. Should be used sparingly. SpaceX is making the valve at the heart of that system.

Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially

Earlier this week, I visited @NIH to donate blood for patients who are involved in clinical trials. The #COVID-19 pandemic has created a blood and plasma shortage in America. If you are a healthy individual, please consider donating blood. One donation can save up to 3 lives.

Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart: https://cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html…

Last launch aborted due to slightly high power. Possibly, but not obviously, related to today. This vehicle has seen a lot of wear, so today isn’t a big surprise. Life leader rockets are used only for internal missions. Won’t risk non-SpaceX satellites.

I spent last weekend in Boca Chica, Texas, visiting SpaceX's manufacturing facilities and speaking with Elon Musk. I have visited a lot of rocket factories, but I've never seen anything like this.

Recent missed landing (at sea) was due to incorrect wind data. If this (land) landing fails, it will most likely be for a different reason.

The joints will have shielding, but it’s hard to ensure a good seal. Transpiration cooling (or simply higher pressure cold gas flow) would purge the area behind the hot gas seal.

No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.

First, we need to make it super safe & easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production & implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards.

Ok sure  Btw, we recruit great engineers from almost anywhere in the world, so this shouldn’t be thought of as USA only. Also, work location can be Bay Area (preferred), but Austin (many of our chip designers are there) or potentially any Tesla Gigafactory.

It will ultimately be used to make up for entire lost sections of the brain due to stroke/accident/congenital. Don’t want to get too excited, but the potential is truly transformational for restoring brain & motor functions. There is no other way to do it imo.

What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity.

Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!

Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool.

Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too.

Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30.

SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.

Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!

Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.

Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.

Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.

This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.

Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen & oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.

NASA selects SpaceX to launch its DART mission, which will intercept the asteroid Didymos’ small moon to test a deflection technique. Total price is $69 million. One wonders what the cost would have been a decade ago.

Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.

Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.

There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.

Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them & we won’t be able to.

All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox & fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness & needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms

Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock & strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.

Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals & bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy & immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.

Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design & replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris…

Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy & internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.

Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density & thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp & up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.

Exactly. Also, you can’t actually use computation from a separate GPU effectively, as you get choked on the bus, so most of the computation is irrelevant. High power, high cooling, but low true, usable TOPS. Worst of all worlds.

It’s not a big deal. Charge to 90% to 95% & you’ll be fine. At 100% state of charge, regen braking doesn’t work, because the battery is full, so car is less energy efficient.

Very much so. There are 2.5B cars & trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -> demand >> supply.

Wow, a lot of people don’t know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.

There is 35 GWh/yr “theoretical capacity”, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3’s in Q1 due to cell constraints.

Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.

Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.

Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn’t critical for snowy regions.

Still get this question a lot, even though Norway  has highest Tesla cars per person on  (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.

SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.

Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.

As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic.

When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!

Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds & small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.
There are nowhere near as many public companies in the US as there should be

Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors & retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return.

Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack.

Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large.

Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit.

So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power.

Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections.

Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.

Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.

I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right.

UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps.

Ride comfort & aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%.

Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort.

Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions & not lose money.

Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” & my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media.

To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production.

The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this.

Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update.

That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.

Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.

The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.
